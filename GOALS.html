   <h1>Our Goals</h1>
    <p>Some of the goals for this project and future possibilities of what we learned in this class:
       To get an A on this project and have at least 90% in this class (please Mr. Millard). If either of us can't get a job that 
       involves what we want to work for, we could BS a computer job. 
       To get a headstart over everyone else when it comes to solving computer problems.</p>
   <h1>Our Separate Goals</h1>
    <p>However many of our goals in life heavily differ. Some of the goals for one of us includes working a job that helps heal and
       fix peoples problems, and the career to do that is preferred to be physical therapy. However, psychology is also a
       possibility because to heal the mind and its realities can cause a domino effect and heal the body as well. 
       The goals for the second of us is to work at a job that is computer related or a job that works around technology.
       Another goal is to learn different types of languages.</p>
