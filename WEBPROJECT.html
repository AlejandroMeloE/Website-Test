    <p>The way to make good bacon is to find some that is thick cut since it has more meat and less fat, which means that when it's cooked
       it will be larger due to less fat being cooked off. This food is really good on many dishes for all meals, such as filet mignon,
       burgers, BLT sandwiches, and makes a insanely good breakfast with egss in the morning.</p>
    <img src="https://allshecooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mozzarella-sticks.jpg" alt="Mozzarella Sticks" width="400" height="400">
    <p>Mozzarella sticks take some effort to make from scratch. First there is the cheese which needs to be cut in a rectangle and 
       should focus on length rather than width, due to a girthy stick taking a longer time to fully cook and will likely lead
       to more cheese melting out, and it cannot be to thin because it will melt to fast and will be undercooked. There is
       also the breading which should have italian seasoning and spices to add some more taste, something that more restaraunts
       should add as it tastes bland and boring.</p>

    <p>Spaghetti is an easy dish to cook, however the hardships do not lie within the cooking, but within the amount of time to cook
       and prepare the dish itself. The meatballs matter and so do the items that go into the sauce. Garlic and bay leaves add much more
       taste in the sauce and adding parmesan cheese to the finished product also adds delectable flavor.</p>
    <img src="https://www.cscassets.com/recipes/wide_cknew/wide_61907.jpg" alt="Cheese Quesidilla" width="1280" height="550">
    <p>The type of cheese and the meat that goes into the quesidilla matters heavily. Two cheeses that complement each other
       is the best option, and the meat should also complement the cheese. Beef and chicken are good meats to add, bacon 
       also being an interesting option.</p>

    <p>Teriyaki is a style that involves marinading a meat with juices in order to change and better the taste. The items 
       added in Teriyaki can greatly differentiate what the tastebuds will feel. Soy sauce is a must-have, but there are options
       to mix in with said soy sauce. There is Saki, Bourbon, Pineapple juice, and other fluids, some containg alcohol and others
       not containing alcohol.</p>
