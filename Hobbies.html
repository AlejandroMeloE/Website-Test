   <h1>Video Games</h1>
    <p>One of our main hobbies are playing video games. 
       It's fun, can be sociable, provides challenge, and some of the stories can be amazing.</p>
    <p>Some of these games are included however not limited to</p>
   <h2>The Dark Souls Franchise</h2>

    <p> The Dark Souls Franchise is a masterpiece that provides a magnificent storyline in a bleak world where everything is
        stagnant and where the main character seems like a spectator in the lives of all the other undead, yet is still 
        chosen one to either rekindle the first flame or choose to cause it to sputter out.</p>
   <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>

    <p> The newly released Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a huge hit on the new console known as the switch, and provides fun
        to the casual players who want to have a good time and has a high enough skill ceiling for all the people that 
        want to be the best in competitive. It also brings back a story mode that while not providing much story, 
        instead providings challenges that range from trivial to frustrating, as well as uninteresting to fantastic.</p>
